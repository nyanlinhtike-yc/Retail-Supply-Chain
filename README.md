## Key Insights 🔍

* The sales trend indicates a **healthy growth** pattern; however, there is a consistent slight **decline in Q2** each year.
* **Friday** and **Sunday** are the most effective days to launch a discount event, while Monday maintains steady sales, and Thursday acts as a sales booster for the weekend.
